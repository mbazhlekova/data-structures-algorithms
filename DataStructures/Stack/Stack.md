# Stack

A Stack is a data structure that can be visualized like a stack of textbooks or plates. The last item to be added to the top of the stack is the first one to be removed. That's why Stacks are referred to as a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. 

## Operations

### push(value)

Adds an element to the top of the stack

### pop()

Removed the top element from a stack

### peek()

Shows the top element in the stack

### size()
